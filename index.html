      <h3>My Short Biography!</h3>
      <br>
      <p>My name is <strong>Elaine</strong>! I go by Uh-laine or Elaine and my friends call me 'Laine'! I am 22 years old, study at Bellevue College and recently started at Code Fellows!<br><br></p>
      <p>Outside of school, I work as a nurse in the ICU! I've been a nurse for almost two years and recently got into graduate school! My hope is to becoming a stronger developer, so I can 
      one day find a job at a company that interests me! <br><br> Outside of work and school, I enjoy cooking. I would say I'm a decent cook and a Seattle foodie! I'm always looking for good food 
      reccomendations! I'm always looking for new books to read, one of my favorites is Paul Kalanithi's <i>When breath becomes air</i>. I highly reccomend this book! I love watching movies, my 
      favorites are Hayao Miyazaki's <i>Spirited Away</i> and <i>The Hobbit</i>!
